# Food Vulnerability Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting health benefits, vulnerability, and impacts of packaged food products. The project leverages a dataset with various features to train models for regression and classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset, `food_vulnerability.csv`, includes the following parameters:

- **category**: The category of the product (e.g., Biscuits, Beverages, Ice Creams, Instant Snacks, Chips and Savories).
- **product_name**: The name of the product (e.g., Oreo Choco Creme).
- **ingredients**: List of ingredients found on the productâ€™s packaging (e.g., Refined wheat flour, Sugar, Edible Vegetable Fat, etc.).
- **allergen_warning**: Any allergen warnings if found on the product (e.g., Contains Wheat, Soy Lecithin). This field may be empty for some products.
- **health_benefits**: A percentage value representing the health benefits of the product, ranging from 1 to 100.
- **vulnerability**: A percentage value representing the vulnerability of the product, ranging from 1 to 100. The sum of `health_benefits` and `vulnerability` equals 100.
- **impact**: The impacts associated with the product, which can be one or more.

## Project Description

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Impact Simplification**: The `impact` parameter is simplified to contain only the first impact for classification.
2. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**: The `product_name` column is dropped as it is not needed for the model.
3. **One-Hot Encoding**: Categorical features (`category`, `ingredients`, and `allergen_warning`) are converted to dummy variables.

### Model Building

- **Regression Model**: A `RandomForestRegressor` is used for predicting `health_benefits` and `vulnerability`. This is a multi-output regression problem.
- **Classification Model**: A `RandomForestClassifier` is used to classify the `impact` based on the features.

### Model Training and Evaluation

- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio.
- **Grid Search**: `GridSearchCV` is employed to find the best hyperparameters for both the regressor and classifier.
- **Cross-Validation**: Cross-validation is performed to evaluate the models.
- **Metrics**: The models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for regression, and accuracy and classification report for classification.

### Model Saving

The best-performing models are saved using `joblib` for future use:

- `model_1_regressor_best.pkl`: The best regression model.
- `model_1_classifier_best.pkl`: The best classification model.
